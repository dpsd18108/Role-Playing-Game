# Introduction

The game will be a Pacman-type game where the bull will have to avoid various enemies and collect as many coins as possible. 

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
As the protagonist of the game is a Bull who replaced Ruby. The Bull was found in Unity Assets.

In the second step we modelled the bull's movement with the arrow keys. It was decided that the bull should have fast movement in the game.<br> 
The track-map was made with tilemap where also the tiles were found in Unity Assets and actually in 16x16 pixel boxes , then I used various objects which I sliced to be able to place them in my scene to make it look like a forest space. Also these were also found via Unity Assets.

# 2nd Deliverable
<br>Track diversification. Adding fences and trees , and correct appearance of objects where the player passes in front and behind.

<br>In the life section, hearts were added as health collectibles which can later be changed as a symbol.

<br>The enemies added are the Fighter and the Bull. The bull reduces two lives instead of one.

<br>Then for animations the player shoots arrows and hits in a similar way.

<br>Finally, changes were made to the Cinemachine packages and the player's view depending on where he goes.

<br>Enemies as particle effects have the spikes that indicate their death when the arrow touches them.
<br>The teleport is done between the two doors. 
<br>As for the Audio, the sound of the forest came in.
